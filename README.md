1 - Setup
Download the data. Link here
Set up your working environment (Python interpreter, venv, Jupyter notebook, etc.). Consider building some base code that will help you expand your project later on. Think ahead!
Manually look through the data, make note of any interesting features and tendencies. 
Remember, this is just the setup and shouldnâ€™t take too long. 
2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (or EDA) means to summarise the main characteristics of the data. This is often done using statistical graphs and other visualisation methods. E.g. histograms/distributions, correlations between features, etc. 
Is there missing data? How will you cope with this?
Categorical versus Numerical data
There are seemingly infinite features to measure, analyse, and graph. Consider which features of the data will be most useful. 
Remember, when you are working on a project, it is often more desirable to have a good solution in a short amount of time, than an amazing solution that is overdue.
